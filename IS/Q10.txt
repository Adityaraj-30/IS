Q10 a) Illustrate Ciphertext only attack 
Ciphertext-only attacks refer to a situation where an attacker has access to only 
the encrypted form of a message or data, and does not have any knowledge 
about the original plaintext. The goal of the attacker in this case is to analyse the 
ciphertext and try to derive information about the original plaintext, such as its 
content or its meaning. Ciphertext-only attacks are often considered the most 
difficult type of attack because the attacker has no knowledge or information 
about the original message or data. 
For example:- 
An attacker has access to following two cipher texts possibly encoded 
with same key. 



Thus, by guessing the key, attacker was able to decode the messages. 
Attacker can also use strategies like frequency distribution of alphabets, 
repetitive pairs of texts in ciphertext, etc. 
Q10 b) Illustrate Known Plaintext attack 
A known plaintext attack occurs when the attacker has access to both the 
plaintext and the corresponding ciphertext. The goal of the attacker in this case 
is to analyse the relationship between the plaintext and the ciphertext, and use 
that information to try to derive the secret key used to encrypt the message. 
Known plaintext attacks are often easier than ciphertext-only attacks because 
the attacker has access to both the plaintext and ciphertext, which can reveal 
important information about the encryption algorithm used. 
For example:- 
An attacker has access to following ciphertext and its corresponding 
plaintext .
